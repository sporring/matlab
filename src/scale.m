function Is = scale(I,s,dr,dc);
%SCALE  Gaussian Scale-Space using the Fourier Domain
%
%       Is = scale(I,s,dr,dc)
%         I - the Fourier transform of a matrix or an image
%         s - the standard deviation of the Gaussian (must be larger than 0)
%         dr - the derivative order in the direction of the rows
%         dc - the derivative order in the direction of the columns
%
%       This is an implementation of the Gaussian scale space on matrices.
%       The convolution is implemented in the Fourier domain and for that
%       reason the number of rows and columns of the matrix must be powers
%       of 2.
%       Fractional valued dr and dc are possible, but be warned the result
%       will probably be complex.
%       The complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the total number
%       of elements of I.
%
%       To calculate an image of scale (variance) 2^2 use,
%         I2 = real(ifft2(scale(fft2(I),2,0,0)));
%       To derive an image once in the direction of rows at scale 1^2 do,
%         I2 = real(ifft2(scale(fft2(I),1,1,0)));

%       Kim S. Pedersen has corrected a minor bug N-1 -> N, May 30, 1999
%       and tested the output against the tgv program, and it delivers the
%       same output.
%
%       Niels H. Olsen has suggested to loosen the constraints of power of 2
%       image sizes.  The code now accepts all images of even sizes.  I'm
%       not sure that the code is optimal for non power of 2 images, but a
%       simple test of cutting before or after scale appears to result only
%       in minor differences.  April 18, 2001.
%
%       I've corrected a minor bug concerning 1D signals.  April 17, 2002.
%
%       Function has been correted to also work on 1d images.  June 16, 2010.
